### Hello, my name is Juan&nbsp;Felipe
<br>I am a 5<sup>th</sup> year Ph.D. Candidate in Mathematics at The University of Iowa, advised by [Prof. Ionu&tcedil; Chifan](https://sites.google.com/view/i-chifan-website/home).<br>
<br>

My area of research is operator algebras, and my main interests lie in the interactions between von Neumann algebras, geometric group theory and ergodic theory.<br>
<br>

#### About me<br>

I grew up in Bogotá, Colombia, and went to undergrad at Universidad de los Andes.  I completed my B.Sc. in Mathematics under the supervision of [Prof. Stefano Ferri](https://matematicas.uniandes.edu.co/es/profesores/stefano-ferri), and my B.Sc. in Physics under the supervision of [Prof. Andrés F. Reyes Lega](https://qft-mathphys.uniandes.edu.co/anreyes/).  Before Iowa, I went to Canada, where I obtained my Master's in Pure Mathematics from the University of Waterloo under the supervision of [Prof. Nico Spronk](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~nspronk/).
